# Covid_Mortality_Prediction
A Summer Internship project using Machine Learning Algorithms 

<br>

## Basic Setup
- Place the Jupyter Notebook and Datasets in the same folder
- Change the path links of dataset in the 'read-method' appropriately

<br>

## Algorithms Used
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

<br>

## Tests Performed
- **TEST 1**: Prediction using the same Features as Test Data
- **TEST 2**: Models for train test split data - Biomarkers selected which genuinely determine the mortality
- **TEST 3**: Combined Set (by using all the Attributes present in the Dataset)
- **TEST 4**: Feature Selection using XGBoost
